# OpenPicasso

Following sourcelocation's departure from the iOS scene, we have decided to open source Picasso to allow the community to continue to use and develop it. OpenPicasso is based on the last commit from the main closed-source repository, with all DRM stripped out. You can build a release version with `ipabuild.sh` and a debug version with `ipabuild_debug.sh`. Make sure to clone [PrivateKits](https://github.com/NSAntoine/PrivateKits) in the same folder the OpenPicasso source is in.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.

Original README continues below.
# Picasso
A jailed customization app for iOS 15.0-17.0.0.

Have fun using!
